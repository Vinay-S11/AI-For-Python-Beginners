## 🍽️ Lesson 3: Reading Journals from Food Critics

### ✨ Overview
In this lesson, you'll explore how AI can classify journal entries from food critics, determining whether a text file is relevant to food and restaurant topics. You’ll work with journal entries, leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze their content, and classify them accordingly.

### 📝 1. Working with Text Data
First, we’ll load and read journal entries from different cities. Let's start by opening and printing the Cape Town journal:


```python
f = open("cape_town.txt", "r")
journal_cape_town = f.read()
f.close()
print(journal_cape_town)
```
Next, open the Tokyo journal and print its contents:

```python
f = open("tokyo.txt", "r")
journal_tokyo = f.read()
f.close()
print(journal_tokyo)
```

#### 🤖 2. Determining Relevance Using LLMs
You will now ask an LLM to determine if a journal entry is relevant to food and restaurants. For example, to check the Tokyo journal, you will define the following prompt:

```python
prompt = f"""Respond with "Relevant" or "Not relevant": 
the journal describes restaurants and their specialties. 

Journal:
{journal_tokyo}"""
print_llm_response(prompt)
```

#### 🔄 3. Checking All Files Using a For Loop
You can iterate over multiple journal files using a for loop. The code below checks if each journal is relevant:

```python
files = ["cape_town.txt", "madrid.txt", "rio_de_janeiro.txt", "sydney.txt", "tokyo.txt"]

for file in files:
    f = open(file, "r")
    journal = f.read()
    f.close()

    prompt = f"""Respond with "Relevant" or "Not relevant": 
    the journal describes restaurants and their specialties. 

    Journal:
    {journal}"""

    print(f"{file} -> {get_llm_response(prompt)}")
```

#### 🔍 4. Investigating an Irrelevant File
If any journal is flagged as "Not relevant," you can print its contents to investigate why:

```python
f = open("madrid.txt", "r")
print(f.read())
f.close()
```

📚 Summary
  - Use AI to classify journal entries as relevant or not to food and restaurants.
  - Work with journal entries from various cities and analyze them with LLMs.
  - Automate the relevance check for multiple files using a for loop.
  - Investigate "Not relevant" entries by reviewing their content.
