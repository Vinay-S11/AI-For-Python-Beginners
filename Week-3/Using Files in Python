## Lesson 1: Using Files in Python

### Overview
In this lesson, you will learn how to read files using Python. You will begin by working with data that has already been stored in files. This includes opening and reading text files using Python, which will be the main focus of the lesson.

To start, load the necessary functions used in the notebook:

python
from helper_functions import get_llm_response
from IPython.display import display, Markdown


### Code Walkthrough

#### 2. Using LLMs to Extract Bullet Points from the Email

python
prompt = f"""Extract bullet points from the following email.
